Whenever youâ€™re writing more than a little snippet of code anywhere on the web, activate GhostText to open your preferred text editor and enjoy your own development environment.

## Installation

GhostText is a browser extension that connects to your editor via its own extension. Install both extensions and, if necessary, start the GhostText server in the editorâ€™s extension.

<h3 id="browser">Choose your browser</h3>

{% include browsers.html %}

<h3 id="editor">Choose your text editor</h3>

{% include editors.html %}

Most editor extensions are by third parties. You can create more extensions for your editor! Refer to the [protocol](https://github.com/fregante/GhostText/blob/main/PROTOCOL.md) file.

## Usage

Once you install both extensions, you can activate GhostText in the current browser tab by clicking its icon in the toolbar or by using a [keyboard shortcut](#keyboard-shortcuts). The editor will need to be already open.

Notice: in some editors youâ€™ll need to run the _Enable GhostText_ command to start the server. Refer to the documentation of your editorâ€™s GhostText extension. Sublime Text doesnâ€™t need this step.

## How it works

GhostText is split in two parts:

1. a HTTP and WebSocket server in the text editor
2. a client in the browser

When you activate GhostText with a click, the browser will try contacting the server in the text editor (at the port specified in the options) and open a WebSocket connection. Every change will be transmitted to the other side. Each side can close the socket (for example by closing the window) and the session will be automatically over.

## Keyboard shortcuts

These are the default shortcuts, they can be [customized in Chrome](https://lifehacker.com/add-custom-keyboard-shortcuts-to-chrome-extensions-for-1595322121) and [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/manage-extension-shortcuts-firefox), but not yet in Safari.
