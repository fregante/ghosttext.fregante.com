_This guide is incomplete. If you're Ruby developer, please help make it as easy as possible to build it._

You can build this locally thanks to the [github-pages gem](https://github.com/github/pages-gem). You'll need both Ruby and Jekyll installed.

## Install

With Ruby 2.7:

```sh
gem install github-pages
```

With Ruby 3.0:

```sh
gem install github-pages
gem install webrick
```

## Run

```sh
jekyll serve
```
