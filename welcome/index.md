## Welcome to GhostText

Make sure to install the GhostText extension in your editor as well, pick one among the ones supported:

{% include editors.html %}

Most editor extensions are by third parties. You can create more extensions for your editor! Refer to the [protocol](https://github.com/fregante/GhostText/blob/main/PROTOCOL.md) file.

## Usage

Once you install both extensions, you can activate GhostText in the current browser tab by clicking its icon in the toolbar or by using a [keyboard shortcut](#keyboard-shortcuts). The editor will need to be already open.

Notice: in some editors youâ€™ll need to run the _Enable GhostText_ command to start the server. Refer to the documentation of your editorâ€™s GhostText extension. Sublime Text doesnâ€™t need this step.
